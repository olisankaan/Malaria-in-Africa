# Malaria-in-Africa
Malaria is one of the most severe public health problems worldwide. It is a leading cause of death and disease in many developing countries, where young children and pregnant women are the groups most affected. According to the 2021 World Malaria Report: Nearly half the worldâ€™s population lives in areas at risk of malaria transmission in 87 countries and territories.
In this project I tried to show how malaria affected different parts of African countries and the death toll increased and decreased from time to time.
